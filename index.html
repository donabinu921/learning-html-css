          ME provides you with a platform to interact with mental health experts
          from all around the globe for free. Instead of clearing your doubts
          via google, which may not always be a reliable source, you can get in
          touch with these professionals every Saturday 4:00pm to 5:00pm for
          free. Online sessions can be attended from the comfort of your homes.
          Anonymity is preserved.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to ensure anonymity, we don't force our participants to
          switch on the camera or unmute themselves during our online sessions.
          The students are free to use the chat box to interact with the
          experts.ME floats a Google form periodically wherein you are free to
          anonymously send in any queries. Our panel doctors answer these
          queries during the month-end sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          ME conducts free webinars every Saturday with mental, physical and
          personality development experts to give you an access to reliable
          information and guide you on your path towards healing and happiness.
          ME puts forth an open forum where you feel safe to discuss your
          emotions without the fear of being ridiculed or misunderstood.
